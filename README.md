## おはよう, YXME there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin
- 🔭 I’m currently working on :
  
  [**LUTECE Platform**](https://lutece.paris.fr) **-** The platform created and maintained by Paris City.

  [**CiteLibre**](https://lutece.paris.fr/lutece/citelibre.html) **-** An open-source software suite based on LUTECE Platform.
  
  **Kiroku -** My own android application to manage my manga library.
  
  **Zenythia -** A discord bot to manage D&D sessions with my friends.

  I'm also contributing to the translation in French of small projects like the [**Time Planner**](https://github.com/v1tzor/TimePlanner) app.
